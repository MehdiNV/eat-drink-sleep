# Project 'Eat, Drink, Sleep' (Title is WIP)

Problems with Status Quo:
It's difficult to be a tourist - you have to plan your itinerary long in advance and research where you have to go for each place.

Our solution:
Here's where we come in. We take inputs from the user (e.g. what do they want to visit? Mueseums, Bars, Historic sights, etc) and use it to calculate a route for them. The route created would not be optimised to save time, but also be chronological in its visit-order (e.g. if a user wants a mueseum first then bar second, then the route would go in that specific order).
